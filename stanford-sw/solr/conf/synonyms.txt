# A synonym file for Solr SynonymFilterFactory.
# Needs to be included at both index and query time 
#  AFTER the case folding
#  BEFORE the WordDelimiterFilterFactory that removes punctuation
# e.g. 
# <analyzer>
#   <tokenizer class="solr.WhitespaceTokenizerFactory" />
#   <filter class="solr.ICUFoldingFilterFactory"/>  <!-- NFKC, case folding, diacritics removed -->

#"Dept." will change to "Department"
#"Koran" will change to "Qur'an"
#"O.T." and "N.T." will change to "Old Testament" and "New Testament"
#"violoncello" will change to "cello"

#Explicit mappings match any token sequence on the LHS of "=>"
#and replace with all alternatives on the RHS.  These types of mappings
#ignore the expand parameter in the schema.
# note that mapping TO the abbreviation improves recall but reduces precision:
#  O.T. can mean Old Testament or overtime;   dept could be a word in some
#  language.
department => dept
#old testament => o.t.
#new testament => n.t.
qurʼan, qur'an, quran, qorʼan, qor'an, qoran => koran
violoncello, violincello => cello

# punctuation-including terms we want to whitelist protect and make searchable.
# We do this by mapping them to unique tokens that do not include punctuation

# computer languages
c++  => cplusplus
j#, j♯ => jsssharp

# musical keys
# c# and f# are computer languages as well as music key signatures,
# We map from number-sign (#), musical sharp (♯)
a#, a♯, a-sharp => a sharp
b#, b♯, b-sharp => b sharp
c#, c♯, c-sharp => c sharp
d#, d♯, d-sharp => d sharp
e#, e♯, e-sharp => e sharp
f#, f♯, f-sharp => f sharp
g#, g♯, g-sharp => g sharp

# We map both from lowercase b and musical flat (♭)
ab, a♭, a-flat => a flat
bb, b♭, b-flat => b flat
cb, c♭, c-flat => c flat
db, d♭, d-flat => d flat
eb, e♭, e-flat => e flat
fb, f♭, f-flat => f flat
gb, g♭, g-flat => g flat

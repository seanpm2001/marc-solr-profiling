This is a FORK of the SolrMarc** project;  it is streamlined for the single
purpose of profiling Marc data with a Solr index.


== Usage

1. clone the project
  git clone git://github.com/solrmarc/marc-solr-profiling.git
2. create a Solr instance for the profiling
** see profiling/solr  for config files, solr war file, solr.xml, etc.
** see Solr project at http://lucene.apache.org/solr
3. run the dist ant task:  
  ant dist
4. create a script to run your marc data through the solrmarc instance to write to a Solr index
(see examples in profiling/scripts)
5. run your script

6. Query the Solr index to see your data


Contributing

1. Fork it
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Added some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)

More on the SolrMarc project

SolrMarc is a utility that reads in MaRC records from a file, extracts 
information from various fields as specified in an indexing configuration 
script, and adds that information to a specified Apache Solr index.

SolrMarc provides a rich set of techniques for mapping the tags, fields, and 
subfields contained in the MARC record to the fields you wish to include in your
Solr documents, but it also allows the creation of custom indexing functions if 
you cannot achieve what you require using the predefined mapping techniques.

Aside from inline comments, the best place to find documentation is on the 
non-forked SolrMarc project pages at
